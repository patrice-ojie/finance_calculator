# Finance Calculator

## Description
This is a program that allows users to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator. 
The investment calculator will give the users information about how much money they can save in a certain period of time. The users are given two options for investment: simple interest and compound interest.
The home loan repayment calculator (named "bond" in the program) will give the users information about how much money they will need to pay each month in order to pay off the loan within the specified time.

## Installation
You can fork a copy of the code in order to work on and amend it as you see fit.
